            <h1>About me (Kevin) </h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Eugene, but I go by Kevin. Unlike most people in America, I wasn’t born here. I moved a
                lot growing up, starting in Congo, then spending half my life in Zambia before coming to the U.S.
                Adjusting to a completely new life was challenging—I had to learn a new language and navigate a culture
                so different from my own. Making friends was tough, too, especially realizing how different I looked
                from most people here. Moving to America changed my life, giving me the chance to meet incredible people
                and experience amazing things.
            </p>
            <p>I’m a simple person, easily content with a great movie or show. Growing up, my widowed mother worked
                tirelessly to support us, leaving my siblings and me alone with the TV as our main companion. Locked
                inside, we spent hours watching together, which not only brought us closer but also sparked my lifelong
                fascination with film and television. Now that we’re all grown and living our own lives, those memories
                remain precious, and even watching alone, I still feel that same joy.
            </p>
            <p>I just want to quit, I don’t wanna play soccer anymore. My passion for soccer was a bright flame that has
                fully been distinguished. When growing up soccer was my whole identity and without soccer I truly
                thought I was a nobody. Once I moved to America, my mother enrolled me into soccer as soon as I touched
                American soil and that's when my love for soccer began to blossom. I played soccer from 1st grade
                through 5th grade and those years were one of the best years of my life. I was extremely good at soccer,
                I even had scouts looking at me and trying to recruit me. I ended up getting recruited to a really good
                soccer team after 5th grade until I had to move school, that single factor changed my soccer career for
                the worse. My mother being a widow and the single provider for our family, she couldn’t take me to
                practice and I had moved too far for my old teammates to take me. In the end I ended up quitting soccer
                but not at my own volition. Due to that single factor I ended up not playing soccer for 3 years and when
                I got into high school, all the skills I had were nowhere to be found. In the end I ended up not making
                the team my freshman year, which crushed me and my passion for soccer slowly started fading. Even though
                I was crushed and sad, my hope never wavered. Thanks to that hope, I made the JV-B and JV teams during
                my sophomore and junior years. Those two years were moments I would never forget, those moments showed
                me why I loved soccer all those years ago. But as I became a senior and made varsity, the flame I once
                had truly disappeared. And suddenly the words “I don’t wanna play soccer anymore” came out of my mouth,
                which is weird because 8 year old me would have never said that.
