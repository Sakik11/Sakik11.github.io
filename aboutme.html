            <h1>About me (Kevin) </h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Eugene but I personally prefer to be called by my middle name Kevin. Unlike most people
                who live in America, I wasn’t born here. In fact I moved a lot, country to country. I was born in Congo
                but was raised in Zambia for half of my life before me and my family moved to America. Being born and
                raised from a whole different continent, it was extremely hard for me to adjust to my new life away from
                everything I knew. I had to learn and master a foreign language that sounded like gibberish compared to
                my own. Making friends was even harder for multiple reasons, but one that stuck out to me was the
                realization that not everyone looked like me. Being from Africa, seeing someone white was extremely rare
                but once I moved here, white people were all I saw. Overall moving to america was truly life changing, I
                was given the opportunity to meet incredible people and experience amazing things.
            </p>
            <p>I’m truly a simple man who is easily pleased by heart. All I need in life is a great movie or a great
                show and I will be content for days. Growing up, my widowed mother was busy providing for our family to
                watch me and my siblings. We also didn’t have the money or the ability to get a babysitter, so my mom
                would always tell me and my siblings to lock the door and not let anyone in. Us being kids and not
                having parents supervision, we were left to our own devices and had no other choice than to watch
                television. This experience brought me and my siblings closer together and it sparked my fascination for
                movies and shows alike. Me and my siblings would spend weeks watching television and those moments have
                defined me as a person. I could never trade those memories for anything. Now that we are older and with
                our own lives, those moments I enjoyed so much as a kid are now in the distant past. Although me and my
                siblings don’t watch TV together, my fascination with movies and shows is still intact. Even Though I
                watch by myself now, the feelings I got when watching Television with my sibling are still there and
                nothing brings me better joy than that feeling.
            </p>
            <p>I just want to quit, I don’t wanna play soccer anymore. My passion for soccer was a bright flame that has
                fully been distinguished. When growing up soccer was my whole identity and without soccer I truly
                thought I was a nobody. Once I moved to America, my mother enrolled me into soccer as soon as I touched
                American soil and that's when my love for soccer began to blossom. I played soccer from 1st grade
                through 5th grade and those years were one of the best years of my life. I was extremely good at soccer,
                I even had scouts looking at me and trying to recruit me. I ended up getting recruited to a really good
                soccer team after 5th grade until I had to move school, that single factor changed my soccer career for
                the worse. My mother being a widow and the single provider for our family, she couldn’t take me to
                practice and I had moved too far for my old teammates to take me. In the end I ended up quitting soccer
                but not at my own volition. Due to that single factor I ended up not playing soccer for 3 years and when
                I got into high school, all the skills I had were nowhere to be found. In the end I ended up not making
                the team my freshman year, which crushed me and my passion for soccer slowly started fading. Even though
                I was crushed and sad, my hope never wavered. Thanks to that hope, I made the JV-B and JV teams during
                my sophomore and junior years. Those two years were moments I would never forget, those moments showed
                me why I loved soccer all those years ago. But as I became a senior and made varsity, the flame I once
                had truly disappeared. And suddenly the words “I don’t wanna play soccer anymore” came out of my mouth,
                which is weird because 8 year old me would have never said that.
