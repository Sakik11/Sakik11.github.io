            <h1>About me (Kevin) </h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Eugene, but I go by Kevin. Unlike most people in America, I wasn’t born here. I moved a
                lot growing up, starting in Congo, then spending half my life in Zambia before coming to the U.S.
                Adjusting to a completely new life was challenging—I had to learn a new language and navigate a culture
                so different from my own. Making friends was tough, too, especially realizing how different I looked
                from most people here. Moving to America changed my life, giving me the chance to meet incredible people
                and experience amazing things.
            </p>
            <p>I’m a simple person, easily content with a great movie or show. Growing up, my widowed mother worked
                tirelessly to support us, leaving my siblings and me alone with the TV as our main companion. Locked
                inside, we spent hours watching together, which not only brought us closer but also sparked my lifelong
                fascination with film and television. Now that we’re all grown and living our own lives, those memories
                remain precious, and even watching alone, I still feel that same joy.
            </p>
            <p>I just want to quit; I don’t want to play soccer anymore. Soccer was once my whole identity—a bright
                flame that’s now fully extinguished. When I moved to America, my mom enrolled me in soccer, and my
                passion took off. From first through fifth grade, I played my best, even drawing scouts’ attention. But
                when we moved, my mom, a single parent, couldn’t manage to get me to practice, forcing me to quit. Those
                years away cost me my skills, and by freshman year, I couldn’t make the team, crushing my spirit.
                Sophomore and junior years brought brief joy on JV, but by senior year on varsity, I realized the fire
                was gone.
